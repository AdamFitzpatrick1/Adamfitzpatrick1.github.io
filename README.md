Version 1 Guide to the world of music

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this website is to educate anyone and everyone about the topic of world music. GCSE revision materials are also included
to help students who are currently studying the GCSE music specification.

Here are the the features that I proposed:

- [x] Zooming accessibility function

- [x] Explaination of world music from various continents

- [x] Images that are relevant to the topics

- [x] Responsive design

- [x] Scripts that enhance user experience

- [x] Forms
